2. With a single regular expression get all services 
that have the string 'file' in their names from /etc/services and are runing only on UDP

# Grep AND
# There is no AND operator in grep. 
# But, you can simulate AND using grep -E option.
# ==exemple===
# grep -E 'pattern1.*pattern2' filename
# 'egrep' is exactly same as 'grep -E'. 
# So, use 'egrep' (without any option) and 
# separate multiple patterns for the or condition.

egrep file.*udp /etc/services
