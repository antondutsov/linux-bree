17. Find all possible command line tools related to XFS administration (at least 5).

	1. xfs_db - debug an XFS filesystem
 xfs_db is used to examine an XFS filesystem. Under  rare  circumstances
       it  can also be used to modify an XFS filesystem, but that task is nor‐
       mally left to xfs_repair or to scripts such as xfs_admin that run
       xfs_db.
	
	2. xfs_admin - change parameters of an XFS filesystem
xfs_admin  uses the xfs_db command to modify various parameters of a
       filesystem.
       Devices that are  mounted  cannot  be  modified.   Administrators  must
       unmount  filesystems  before xfs_admin or xfs_db can convert parame‐
       ters.  A number of parameters of a mounted filesystem can  be  examined
       and modified using the xfs_growfs command.

	3. xfs_copy - copy the contents of an XFS filesystem
xfs_copy  copies  an  XFS filesystem to one or more targets in parallel.
       The first (source) argument must be the pathname of  the
       device  or  file containing the XFS filesystem. The remaining arguments
       specify one or more target devices or  file  names.  If  the  pathnames
       specify devices, a copy of the source XFS filesystem is created on each
       device. The target can also be the name of a  regular  file,  in  which
       case  an image of the source XFS filesystem is created in that file. If
       the file does not exist, xfs_copy creates the file. The length  of  the
       resulting  file is equal to the size of the source filesystem. However,
       if the file is created on an XFS filesystem, the file consumes  roughly
       the  amount  of  space  actually  used  in the source filesystem by the
       filesystem and the XFS log.  The space saving is because xfs_copy seeks
       over  free  blocks  instead of copying them and the XFS filesystem sup‐
       ports sparse files efficiently.
	xfs_copy uses synchronous  writes  to  ensure  that  write  errors  are
       detected.
       	xfs_copy  uses  pthreads(7)  to  perform  simultaneous parallel writes.
       xfs_copy creates one additional thread for each target to  be  written.
       All threads die if xfs_copy terminates or aborts.

	4. xfs_repair - repair an XFS filesystem
 xfs_repair repairs corrupt or damaged  XFS  filesystems.
       The  filesystem  is specified using the device argument which should be
       the device name of the disk partition or volume containing the filesys‐
       tem.  If  given  the name of a block device, xfs_repair will attempt to
       find the raw device associated with the specified block device and will
       use the raw device instead.
       Regardless, the filesystem to be repaired must be unmounted, otherwise,
       the resulting filesystem may be inconsistent or corrupt.

	5. xfs_check - check XFS filesystem consistency
xfs_check checks whether an XFS filesystem is consistent.  It  is  nor‐
       mally  run only when there is reason to believe that the filesystem has
       a consistency problem.  The filesystem to be checked  is  specified  by
       the  device argument, which should be the disk or volume device for the
       filesystem.  Filesystems stored in files can also be checked, using the
       -f  flag. The filesystem should normally be unmounted or read-only dur‐
       ing the execution  of  xfs_check.   Otherwise,  spurious  problems  are
       reported.
       Note  that using xfs_check is NOT recommended. Please use xfs_repair -n
       instead, for better scalability and speed.

	6. xfs_io - debug the I/O path of an XFS filesystem	
xfs_io  is  a  debugging tool like xfs_db, but is aimed at examining
       the regular file I/O paths rather  than  the  raw  XFS  volume  itself.
       These  code  paths  include not only the obvious read/write/mmap inter‐
       faces for manipulating files, but also cover all of the XFS  extensions
       (such as space preallocation, additional inode flags, etc).

	7. xfs_quota - manage use of quota on XFS filesystems
xfs_quota is a utility for reporting and  editing  various  aspects  of
       filesystem quota.

	8. xfs_growfs, xfs_info - expand an XFS filesystem
xfs_growfs expands an existing XFS filesystem .  The mount-
       point argument is the pathname of the directory where the filesystem is
       mounted. The filesystem must be mounted to  be  grown .
       The  existing contents of the filesystem are undisturbed, and the added
       space becomes available for additional file storage.
       xfs_info is equivalent to invoking xfs_growfs with the -n  option.
